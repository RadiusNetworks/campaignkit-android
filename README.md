#Campaign Kit Library for Android Client

Requirements for use: 

* Android API Level 18 or higher

* Google Play Services library set as a dependency if using Geofencing features.

* CampaignKit.properties file downloaded from campaignkit.radiusnetworks.com.




##Sample Reference Apps

We've created some simple apps that demonstrate usage of the Campaign Kit Library.

For Android Studio users:
https://github.com/RadiusNetworks/campaignkit-reference-android-studio

For Eclipse users:
https://github.com/RadiusNetworks/campaignkit-reference-android




##Getting Started


1) If you haven't downloaded the Campaign Kit Library and set it up as a dependent library to your project, please [DO THAT FIRST](https://github.com/RadiusNetworks/campaignkit-documentation/blob/master/docs/android/download.md).


2) Implement CampaignKitNotifier and CampaignKitManager

 * Open the Application class in your project. If you don't have one, create a class that extends Application.

 * Type 'extends Application implements CampaignKitNotifier" after the class name in its declaration. At first, it'll say that class is unrecognized. You need to quick fix or manually import the CampaignKitNotifier class to resolve the error.

 * Add all required methods for the CampaignKitNotifier. Quick-fix can do this for you (move your cursor onto CampaignKitNotifer and press ALT + ENTER on Android Studio or CMD + 1 on Eclipse for mac).

 * In your Application class, add a private instance of CampaignKitManager. At first, it'll say that class is unrecognized. You need to quick fix or manually import the CampaignKitManager class to resolve the error. It should look like this:

```java
private CampaignKitManager _ckManager;
```

 * In the Application class's onCreate() method, add the following code:

```java 
    _ckManager = CampaignKitManager.getInstanceForApplication(this);
    _ckManager.start();
    _ckManager.setNotifier(this);
``` 
 * So your Application class should look like this now:

```java
public class MyApplication extends Application implements CampaignKitNotifier {

    public CampaignKitManager _ckManager;

    @Override
    public void onCreate() {
        super.onCreate();
        _ckManager = CampaignKitManager.getInstanceForApplication(this);

        _ckManager.setNotifier(this);

        _ckManager.start();

    }
```

3) Handle didFindCampaign callback from CampaignKitNotifier

```java

  @Override
  public void didFindCampaign(Campaign campaign) {

    //displaying Campaign content
    showCampaign(campaign);
  }

  public void showCampaign(Campaign campaign){
    // TODO: write custom code or use code from the Campaign Kit reference app
  }
```



##Adding Geofence Support

Since geofence support is relatively new, it is disabled by default. Below are
the steps necessary to configure a sample app to use geofences through
Campaign Kit.

1) Install Google Play services. Due to the differences between Eclipse and
   Android Studio please refer to the [Google Setup docs](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html)
   for the proper IDE instructions.


   - Android SDK Manager > Extras > Google Play services

2) If using Android Studio, Include the Google Play services as a dependency in `app/build.gradle`:

```groovy
  // PROJECT_ROOT/app/build.gradle
  dependencies {
      compile 'com.android.support:appcompat-v7:+'
      compile 'com.google.android.gms:play-services:5.+'
      compile fileTree(dir: 'libs', include: ['*.jar'])
      compile project(":campaignkit-android")
  }
```

3) Declare the Google Play service in the app's `AndroidManifest.xml` under the
   `<application>` section:

```xml
  <meta-data
      android:name="com.google.android.gms.version"
      android:value="@integer/google_play_services_version" />
```

4) Declare that the app needs to request `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`. To request
   this permission, add the following element as a child element of the
   `<manifest>` element:

```groovy
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION"/>
```

5) Check for Google Play support. For the most recent suggestions by Google,
   please refer to the [Android documentation on checking for Google Play
   services support](https://developer.android.com/google/play-services/setup.html#ensure).

  > Because each app uses Google Play services differently, it's up to you
  > decide the appropriate place in your app to check verify the Google Play
  > services version. For example, if Google Play services is required for your
  > app at all times, you might want to do it when your app first launches. On
  > the other hand, if Google Play services is an optional part of your app,
  > you can check the version only once the user navigates to that portion of
  > your app.
  >
  > To verify the Google Play services version, call
  > `isGooglePlayServicesAvailable()`. If the result code is `SUCCESS`, then
  > the Google Play services APK is up-to-date and you can continue to make a
  > connection. If, however, the result code is `SERVICE_MISSING`,
  > `SERVICE_VERSION_UPDATE_REQUIRED`, or `SERVICE_DISABLED`, then the user
  > needs to install an update. So, call
  > `GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog()` and pass it the result error
  > code. This returns a `Dialog` you should show, which provides an
  > appropriate message about the error and provides an action that takes the
  > user to Google Play Store to install the update.


```java

  /**
   * Verify that Google Play services is available before making a request.
   *
   * @return true if Google Play services is available, otherwise false
   */
  private boolean servicesConnected() {

      // Check that Google Play services is available
      int resultCode =
              GooglePlayServicesUtil.isGooglePlayServicesAvailable(this);

      // If Google Play services is available
      if (ConnectionResult.SUCCESS == resultCode) {

          // In debug mode, log the status
          Log.d(TAG, "Google Play services available");

          // Continue
          return true;

      // Google Play services was not available for some reason
      } else {

          // Display an error dialog
          Dialog dialog = GooglePlayServicesUtil.getErrorDialog(resultCode, this, 0);
          if (dialog != null) {
              ErrorDialogFragment errorFragment = new ErrorDialogFragment();
              errorFragment.setDialog(dialog);
              errorFragment.show(getSupportFragmentManager(), TAG);
          }
          return false;
      }
  }

  /**
   * Define a DialogFragment to display the error dialog generated in
   * showErrorDialog.
   */
  public static class ErrorDialogFragment extends DialogFragment {

      // Global field to contain the error dialog
      private Dialog mDialog;

      /**
       * Default constructor. Sets the dialog field to null
       */
      public ErrorDialogFragment() {
          super();
          mDialog = null;
      }

      /**
       * Set the dialog to display
       *
       * @param dialog An error dialog
       */
      public void setDialog(Dialog dialog) {
          mDialog = dialog;
      }

      /*
       * This method must return a Dialog to the DialogFragment.
       */
      @Override
      public Dialog onCreateDialog(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
          return mDialog;
      }
  }

```

6) If Google Play is available, enable geofences for Campaign Kit.

```java

  ckManager = CampaignKitManager.getInstanceForApplication(this);
  if (servicesConnected()) {
      try {
          ckManager.enableGeofences();
      } catch (GooglePlayServicesException e) {
          Log.e(TAG, "Failed to enable geofences: " + e.getMessage());
      }
  }
  ckManager.setNotifier(this);
  ckManager.start()

```
